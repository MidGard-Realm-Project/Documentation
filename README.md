## Server Concept:
* The main objective of this Server is to bring back the old sensation of playing Tales of Pirates, appeal to the nostalgia, to achieve this, it's important to avoid changes in the original city maps, keep the game simple with the original features, we don't need new fancy gameplay mechanics, instead, we gonna keep the essence of the game but rework or best use features and mechanics that already exist in the game such as quests, skills, crafting etc.
We want to create game content for at least within a year of gaming, of course this means we are going to develop our content and add new features slowly to not overwhelm the players.

### Quest:
If there is an useless feature in this game is questing, quest are easy to do, create new useful quest should not be a problem, doing quest is always a fun thing to do, instead of infinite grinding, questing give the player a purpose inside the game, giving the satisfaction of a accomplish a small goal is something only a quest can give, but when the reward is useless doing them is pointless, to solve this we are going to rework the quests rewards and remove all the unused, useless quests.
